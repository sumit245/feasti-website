              For me, Feasti has been the perfect platform to exhibit my skills,
              talents and interests in cooking. My partnership with Feasti has
              been comfortable, convenient and long mainly because of their
              efficient, organised working system. The highlight is the
              compatibility, I have the freedom to work based on my convenience
              and also choose dishes that I specialize in. Over the years,
              Feasti has served as a platform for me to do a business of my own
              and make an earning. I’m not only happy but also proud to be
              associated with Feasti as a chef.

            I have always been passionate about cooking, it gives me a certain
            joy when I’m cooking for people. I enjoy the process of trying out
            new recipes and coming up with some of my own, it is my approach to
            staying stress-free. Joining Feasti as a chef gave me the
            opportunity to prepare a variety of dishes in my very own kitchen
            and share it with people who love homemade food as much as me! I
            have become more confident through my partnership with Feasti as the
            process involves planning, purchases and cooking at a fast pace. The
            Feasti team are a bunch of sincere and dedicated people,
            occasionally convincing me to make more quantity to meet the high
            demand. Over the short time that I have been a Feasti chef partner,
            they have become an extension of my kitchen, constantly
            communicating with me and giving feedback.
