          We believe in providing the shefs in our community — individuals who
          have always dreamt of building their own food business — the
          opportunity to make a meaningful income by doing what they love! We
          also believe that every person should have access to a wholesome,
          homemade meal at an affordable price.
          <strong>
            Building a community devoted to economic empowerment and cultural
            inclusivity
          </strong>{" "}
          — that’s why we started Feasti.
